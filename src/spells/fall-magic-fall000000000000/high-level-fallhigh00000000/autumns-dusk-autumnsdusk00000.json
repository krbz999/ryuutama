      "value": "<p>The most beautiful sight to behold in autumn is dusk, when the subtlety and elegance of all things in nature can be felt the most; even crows in the sky. The targets may fly with a flock of migrating birds. Calling a flock of migrating birds from a range of one kilometer, the targets may fly to the same destination as the flock. The spellâ€™s effect wears off when the birds land. Details such as whether and how many birds are nearby, and how far they are flying are left up to the GM.</p>"
