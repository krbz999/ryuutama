When you choose the Farmer Class, choose a single Skill from any other class that requires a Skill Check. You may use that skill as if you were a member of that class. However, you aren't as practiced as a person of that class, so you will always have a -1 penalty to the check.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Effect:</strong> Use a single skill from another class with a -1 penalty</p>\n<p><strong>Usable Circumstances:</strong> Depends on the skill</p>\n<p><strong>Stat Used:</strong> Depends on the skill</p>\n<p><strong>TN:</strong> Depends on the skill</p>"
